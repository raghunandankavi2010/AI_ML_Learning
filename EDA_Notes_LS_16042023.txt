EDA :
------
 -> Exploratory Data Analysis

. The process of performing analysis on data to discover the patterns which describe the data
like mean, mode, median, range, graphs etc to find the hidden pattern on dataset.
. It is a good approach to analyse the data and gather the possible insights

ML Lifecycle :
---------------
Import Data --> Data exploration --> Peform Data Cleaning --> Data Preparation --> Data partiations into  Train  -> Model Building      --
			Test  -> Model Evaluation     ---> Model Deploy
			Split		

Training data :
----------------
Data which is used to get the model accuracy to the max or the available data which was used earlier to get the model accuracy.

Test Data :
------------
Data which is unseen/initial data/new data and used to get the model fitment.

Data Exploration :
-------------------
	-> No of rows and columns
	-> Type of Columns
	-> Column name
	-> Missing Values
	-> Distribution of Data
	-> Outliers
	-> class imbalance

Data Cleaning :
----------------
	-> Hanlde missing values
	-> Drop unnecessery columns
	-> Data cleaning column

Data Preparation :
-------------------
	-> Create more columns [Based on requirements]
	-> Scaling
	-> Data transformation

Data :
-------
	1. Public
	2. Private

Variables :
--------------
	1. Continuous - numerical in nature and can attain any values
	eg: Age, marks, salary etc
	
	2. Categorical - discrete in nature and have specific category
	eg: Gender, Week days etc

Categorical Variables :
-------------------------
	1. Ordinal - Individual categories are comparable or follows the order
	eg: Rating

	2. Nominal - individual categories which are non comparable
	eg: Colours, Gender etc


Outliers :
-------------
	-> Extreme low or high values which changes the distribution of the data
	eg: Salary = [90k, 40k, 45k, 80k, 75k]
		Avg  = 55k
	By adding CEO salary = 1000K to Salary then the avg salary is 550K which is not definate value hence the outlier creates wrong data distribution or analysis.

Therefore, in some cases outliers will be removed or kept

Handling Missing Values :
--------------------------
Suggested Approach:
	-> Business Knowledge
	-> Mean, Mode or Median
	-> Remove data

if the missing values are >60% then discuss with client what to fill it with or decide whether to keep the values or remove it based on business knowledge.


Scaling :
----------
	-> The purpose of the scaling is to put all the columns into similar scales to compare the values easily and therefore the ML algorithm peforms well on model building.
	-> Its better to keep the scaling between 0-1

1. Min-Max Scaling :
	-> Implement it on the basis of outliers
2. Standardization Scaling : 
	-> Implement it on Mean
